GeneFlow: Tool to analyze gene expression data
====================================

GeneFlow is a scalable and flexible software library that encompasses data acquisition methods,
preprocessing techniques, data analytics, data visualization, and Machine Learning algorithms 
that can be applied to genomic data. 

* Enable users to work with several datasets simultaneously without having to worry about low-level implementation details.

* Represents the process workflow in a semi-structured format in order to facilitate the realization of complex experiments.

* Provides the ability of replaying a complete workflow to reconstruct the steps so that experiments can be reproduced and replicated as needed or applied to different datasets.
