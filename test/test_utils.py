# A unit test is a test that checks a single component of code, 
# usually modularized as a function, and ensures that it performs as expected.
# Unit tests in PyUnit are structured as subclasses of the unittest.TestCase class,
# and we can override the runTest() method to perform our own unit tests
# which check conditions using different assert functions in unittest.TestCase
